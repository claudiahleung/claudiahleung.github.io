        <h2>Hey there! I'm Claudia and I study Psychology, Political Science, and Computer Science at McGill University.</h2>
        <p class="lead">I am on the search for an internship this summer in software development, UX Research, or marketing.</p>
        <p class="lead">In addition to a full course load, I am currently involved in two psychology labs and three clubs, which gives me a lot of opportunities for side projects!</p>
        <p class="lead">Over the past academic year, I've served as Editorial Lead for the McGill AI Society (incoming VP Communications for 2019-2020), data analyst for the McGill Peer Support Centre, a member of the data collection team for McGill NeuroTech - where we've been working to build a brain controlled wheelchair! - and a UX Researcher for eRA Rehab, where I conduct literature reviews on pain and motivation mechanisms to design the UI for a mobile app. I am also a Research Assistant for a Neurolinguistics Lab, and a web assistant for Communication Sciences lab.</p>
        <p class="lead">Watch out for this space for updates as I share my work and experiences over the past year!!</p>
