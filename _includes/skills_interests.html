              </h4>
              <p>With a concentration in Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience, I learn about anything ranging from memory formation, cortical pathways, and drug design in my psychology degree. While most of my degree can be characterised by lab work, scantrons, and rigorous literature reviews, my psych degree is ultimately what inspired by enthusiasm for human centred design in both market solutions and research methods in the social sciences.</p>

              </h4>
              <p>From academic writing to blogging, editorials, and copywriting for social media and sponsorship, my writing has impacted a wide range of different audiences for different purposes. At the moment, I am preparing a paper for publication while editing 25 blogs for the McGill AI Society bootcamp, and preparing new content for the club's Medium blog.</p>

              </h4>
              <p>After attending a few hackathons and dabbling here and there with webdev and Google APIs, I decided that I wanted to learn how to code - properly - to build my own programs from scratch. I started to learn Python in my free time, and signed up for several computer science courses to speed up my learning process. I am currently sharpening up on data structures and learning about algorithms. </p>

                <strong>Data Visualisation and Graphic Design</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>As a strong advocate of knowledge translation across different fields of study, I feel that knowledge translation is best achieved through graphic design and user-friendly interfaces. Working on the data collection team at McGill NeuroTech showed me how subpar data visualisations can have a huge impact on the methodology for data collection. I volunteer for Viz for Social Good on an adhoc basis to make infographics for mission-driven organisations, and hope to improve my skills in graphic design as I take on the role of VP Communications for the McGill AI Society next year.</p>
