</h1>

<div>
	<h2>
		I am a <span class="emphasis">budding technologist</span>, <span class="emphasis">neuroscience enthusiast</span>, and a <span class="emphasis">dedicated social scientist</span> - sometimes all at once. I am broadly interested in <span class= "emphasis"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science" target="_blank">computational social science</a></span>, philosophical issues in VR, and ongoing research in Alzheimer's, pain studies, and women's health.
	<br><br>
	I'm wrapping up my final year of undergraduate study at <span class="emphasis">McGill University</span>. ️When I’m not bustling around campus taking a hodge-podge of courses in computer science and the humanities, you’ll find me working on my French, exploring new technologies, and reading and writing as much as I can. 

	<br><br>
	During my time here, I’ve served on the executive team of the <span class= "emphasis"><a href="mcgillai.com/" target="_blank">McGill AI Society</a></span>,	analysed data for the <span class="emphasis"><a href="https://psc.ssmu.ca/" target="_blank">Peer Support Centre</span></a>, written for the campus newspaper, and led the software and data teams for a neurotech project. I also conducted health research in rural Uganda and worked as a Research Assistant in labs specialising in neurolinguistics and communication sciences.
